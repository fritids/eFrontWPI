I think its probably going to be the cookie..

I think I’ll need to make a minor change to load the eFront libraries/global.php directly, so that any change would use their md5 salt du jour.

I’ve made some small changes to do so – see below for what to change.
Can you try this in your side and see if this works (or gives an error), then let me know!
Then I can either remedy,or update the plugin zip file to include this.

Open eFrontWPI.php in the wordpress plugins folder, and change the eFrontWPI_set_cookie code to the below.

function eFrontWPI_set_cookie($username,$password) {
//G_MD5KEY from eFront libraries/globals.php
//eFront needs a cookie also.
//define(“G_MD5KEY”, ‘cDWQR#$Rcxsc’);

global $eFrontWPI_options;

$myfile = $eFrontWPI_options['path'] . ‘/libraries/globals.php’;

if (($file_handle = @fopen($myfile, ‘r’)) === false) {
//Can’t find the globals file
return new WP_Error(‘eFrontWPI_server_error’, __(‘eFrontWPI: Attempted to load globals.php file, but failed. Does this path look correct: ‘.$myfile));
}
else {
@include $myfile;
//define(“G_MD5KEY”, ‘cDWQR#$Rcxsc’) should be defined from above include..
}

setcookie(“cookie_login”, $username,time()+3600,’/');
setcookie(“cookie_password”, md5($password.G_MD5KEY),time()+3600,’/');
}
